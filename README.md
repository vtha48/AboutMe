About Me
Hello, I'm Võ Thị Hoài Anh! I am passionate about exploring new technologies and eager to experience various AI tools. With a foundation in Mathematics and Statistics and expertise in data analysis, particularly in data pre-processing and visualization, I bring a unique blend of skills to the Data Analyst field. As a candidate aspiring for a Data Analyst role, I am excited to showcase my technical and analytical talents in the realm of Data Science.

During my university years at the University Of Sciences, Hue University, I excelled in developing software and building websites tailored to the subjects' needs. However, I discovered my affinity for working with data and redirected my coding and software development skills towards the Data Science domain. Now, I confidently affirm my ability to work with complex data and possess a keen eye for identifying trends and patterns.

Through university lab courses, I gained expertise in leadership, data management, statistical analysis, and machine learning. I believe these skills will be valuable for my next venture as a Data Analyst.

In my free time, I actively explore new data analysis tools and methodologies, always seeking ways to expand my knowledge and refine my skills. If you are looking for someone with a unique combination of software development and data analysis skills, I would love to discuss how I can contribute to your projects and organization. Please contact me, and let's embark on a data-driven journey together!

My CV and projects are included in the repository. For more details, please visit my LinkedIn page.
